# CLAUDE.md for a Supercomputer Resource Management System

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository. The application is a very easy to use single page app with multiple tabs. It will be entirely vibe coded using Claude code.

## Overview

`Woerk` is a user profile, project, resource and data management and resource allocation tool that serves as a self service management and gateway application for a large AI supercomputer at our university. `Woerk` will be installed in a cloud instance (AWS) and users from inside the university (Faculty, Staff) as well as external users from other universities can connect to an easy to use web ui. In addition, software agents can connect to this platform to send and retrieve information and to retrieve commands. Software agents can use a compination of REST/API and web sockets. The agents are often written in Python or Bash

## Development stack

Please use this stack to generate code, We are using a Ubuntu 24.04 workstation With Node.js 24.0 and a local Postgres 16.9 installed (JSONB supported)

- TypeScript end to end:
  - Strong typing across API contracts reduces regressions as we add features quickly.
  - Shared type definitions between frontend and backend minimize drift.
- Next.js (App Router) + React:
  - Production-grade SSR/SSG, great DX, huge ecosystem, fast UI delivery.
  - Easy integration with Auth.js and edge caching if needed.
- NestJS (Node 20, Fastify adapter), Build REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, Queues, :
  - Opinionated structure, DI, modules â†’ maintainable as the app grows.
  - First-class docs (Swagger), guards/interceptors for auth/rate-limits, simple testing.
- PostgreSQL + Prisma:
  - Strong relational model (users, orgs, projects, roles/permissions, tasks, audit logs).
  - Prisma = fast migrations, excellent DX, typed queries, JSONB support for flexible data.
- pg-boss:
  -  message queue, backround jobs
- auth.js (NextAuth):
  -  Google/GitHub/Microsoft/SAML/OIDC with minimal boilerplate; sessions stored in Postgres.
-  Python for software agents 
  - Asynchronous Framework: asyncio (standard library)
  - Command Execution: subprocess (standard library, with asyncio wrappers)
  - Retries/Backoff: tenacity
  - Configuration: python-dotenv (for .env files), YAML or JSON for complex configs.
  - Logging: logging (standard library)
  - Systemd Integration: Standard I/O for logs, sdnotify (optional but good) for service status.

## Database structure

## Application UI Structure

### Tab 1: User Account Management

**User Registration & Authentication:**

- Users sign up with their university email address, enter .edu emil address -> next -> check if account already exists, prompt for auth option (password for external users, azure login for internal -> if account does not exist send link via email to setup new account or, if university is integrated redirect authentication to university)
- Email verification required, email needs to e verified at regular intervals configured by administrator
- some university email domains will be integrated via federation (for example oregonstate.edu). Needs to be configurable by admin 
- 
- Basic information collection:
  - Full name
  - Title/Position
  - Role: staff / professional faculty or Faculty
  - University and Department

**Linked Identity Management:**
Users can link additional identities:

1. **Google Account** - Not necessarily ending with university email domain, store email identity and underlying long int google id
2. **GitHub Account** - For code repository integration, store the github user id as well as the unterlying long int github numeric id
3. **ORCID Account** - For researcher identification
4. **LinkedIN account** - For addional infornmation (required for users that do not have an .edu email address )

Default billing information: for home university (e.g. oregonstate.edu) these need to be 2 fields: Default Index (billing account) and "Default Activity Code" or users will not be able to create woerk IDs 

### Tab 2: Resource Management

#### Projects / Woerks 

**Project Management System:**

- Users can create new projects (called "woerks")
- Projects displayed in a list view

**Project Attributes:**

- **Woerk ID**: randomly assinged 5-character alphanumeric identifier with hyphen as middle character (e.g., AB-12). The alphanumeric identifier must be glo
- **Short Name**: Maximum 30 characters
- **Description**: Maximum 1024 characters

**Project Classification:**

- **Non-grant Projects**: No additional metadata required
- **U.S. Federal Projects**:
  - Search interface connected to grants.gov API
  - Multi-word search capability across all fields
  - API endpoints:
    - `https://www.grants.gov/api/common/search2`
    - `https://www.grants.gov/api/common/fetchopportunity`
  - Retrieved data stored locally:
    - Project ID
    - Funding agency
    - API information
    - Project description
  
#### Allocations 

### Tab 3: Authorization Management

**Group Management:**

- Integration with LDAPS and Grouper API
  - See Grouper Rest API  
  - https://software.internet2.edu/grouper/doc/master/grouper-ws-parent/grouper-ws/apidocs/edu/internet2/middleware/grouper/ws/rest/package-summary.html
  - https://github.com/Internet2/grouper/tree/GROUPER_5_BRANCH/grouper-ws/grouper-ws/src/grouper-ws/edu/internet2/middleware/grouper/ws/rest
- Groups assigned to specific projects
- Features:
  - Project selection dropdown
  - List of all groups assigned to selected project
  - Create new groups
  - Manage group membership

### Tab 4: File Management

**Web-based File Transfer Interface:**

- Upload and download capabilities
- Target folder selection via dropdown menu
- Support for both:
  - POSIX-based storage
  - S3-based storage

### Tab 5: Terminal Access

**SSH Terminal Component:**

- Based on xterm.js (https://xtermjs.org/)
- Direct login to bastion SSH host
- Authentication via secure SSH certificates

## Technical Requirements

- Multi-university support (approximately 12 institutions)
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Integration with external APIs (grants.gov, LDAPS/Grouper)
- Web-based terminal emulation
- Support for multiple storage backends

### Tab 6: Github Access

- by default empty tab unless users have linked their github account in Tab 1, point users to tab 1
- searchable pull down field that allows you to either pick or enter a github https://url
